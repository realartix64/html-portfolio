        <ul>
            <li>
                Organized and led a 3-member electrical design team for a remote-controlled
                sumo bot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Integrated the drive circuit by breadboarding 7 components including an Arduino
                microcontroller with an h-bridge motor driver, and a bluetooth component
            </li>
            <li>
                Soldered and assembled wiring for 4 DC motors into a functional control system.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li><h3>Earthquake Simulator Project</h3></li>
        
        <p>University of Central Florida - Orlando, FL | Jan 2025 - May 2025</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                    Developed a customizable 2D simulation where users defined fault-line coordinates
                    across a dynamic grid of 0s of any size defined by the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                    Implemented probabilty-weighted number generation (0-100) that increased earthquake
                    likelihood along user defined fault lines - including diagonal paths and circular faults.
            </li>
            <li>
                    Programemed termination logic to detect seismic events when any grid cell reached 100, modeling
                    an earthquake trigger condition.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li><h3>Matrix Calculator</h3></li>
        <p>University of Central Florida - Orlando, FL | May 2025 - Aug 2025</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Built a C-based matrix calculator supporting operations on matrices up to 5x5, including addition
                multiplication, transposition, and determinants.
            </li>
        </ul>
